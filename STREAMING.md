## Organization & Community Caster Streaming

## Important Information

### Official Crossfire Coverage

❌ **If we are covering a game on any Crossfire channel, we will NOT be allowing community casters to cover those games.**

✅ **However**, if we know that you typically cover a team or org (example being the NuT crew always covering), we will try to avoid those games as much as we can so you guys can produce your own content! 😄

### Different Language Broadcasts

🌍 **IF you are wanting to cover a main broadcast in a DIFFERENT language that's not English**, ask in the community casting channel so you may be granted permission.

### Game Availability

📢 We will put in the community casters chat any games that are up for grabs if you are wanting to cover games on a personal or ORG channel!

## CSTV Access

### What is CSTV?

CSTV allows approved community members to broadcast Crossfire matches using server IPs.

### How to Get CSTV Access

1. Go to 🚨┃make-a-ticket in the Discord
2. Request CSTV access
3. Once approved, you'll gain access to the broadcast channels where CSTV IPs will be posted

### CSTV Availability
