## Core Roster Policy

Within CrossfireGG, the term "Roster" refers to the Core-3 player identity used for competitive integrity.

**All teams**, including VRS and non-VRS participants, must maintain a minimum core of three (3) players once roster lock is reached.

### Roster Lock

- Rosters lock fourteen (14) days before event start (February 16, 2026)
- The core-3 represents the competitive identity of the team for seeding and eligibility purposes

### VRS Teams

- Must maintain at least three (3) players from the official VRS snapshot roster (February 2, 2026)
- Changing one or two players before lock does NOT affect VRS eligibility
- If a VRS team changes its core and drops below three snapshot players, the team loses VRS eligibility AND will be disqualified from the tournament to preserve competitive integrity

### Non-VRS Teams

- Must also maintain a core of three (3) registered players after roster lock
- Breaking the core requirement may result in admin disqualification

### Duplicate Core Restrictions

- **Duplicate core rosters are not allowed** — no two teams may share 3 or more core players
- Teams found in violation will be disqualified
- This rule ensures roster integrity across the competitive landscape

---

## Seeding Integrity Policy

- Seeding reflects the roster identity present at roster lock
- Core-3 continuity ensures fair seeding stability
- Seeding becomes final at roster lock date (February 16, 2026)
- Teams disqualified due to core violations will not retain seeded positions

---

## Tournament Format

### Group Stage

- **Format:** GSL-style Group Stage
- **Structure:** 8 Groups × 4 Teams (32 teams total)
- **Match Type:** All matches are Best-of-3 (BO3)
- **Duration:** March 2 - March 22, 2026
- **Advancement:** Top 2 teams from each group advance to Playoffs (16 teams total)

**Match Rounds:**

- Round 3: March 16-22 (Default: Friday, March 20 @ 8 PM EST)

### Seeding Method

Teams are seeded using a **separated seeding methodology** to ensure competitive balance:

1. **Seeds 1-8** are placed in separate groups — one top seed per group
2. **Seeds 9-16** are distributed across all groups
3. **Seeds 17-24** are distributed across all groups
4. **Seeds 25-32** are distributed across all groups

This ensures each group contains a mix of skill levels and prevents stacking.
